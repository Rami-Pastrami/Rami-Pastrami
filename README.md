**"Knowledge is Power. Knowledge Shared is Power Multiplied"**

Just another nerd doing some odd-ball stuff with VR and BCI. I believe social VR has the power to bring us together, and our open software shall be what empowers that!

I have a plethora of experience with the Unity and Godot Game engines, and C#, Python, MATLAB, and HLSL as programming languages. I am currently self-studying lower level languages such as C++ as well.

Proud owner of a classic ERS-7:

Current Projects:

- Adding EEG to a Big Screen Beyond VR Headset
- Developing a modern python library for the ERS-7 wifi controls
- VRC_SLT: Sign Language Trancsription for VRChat
- My Voron Trident
- 300+ other things

See my blog where I talk about random stuff or  WIP projects before I make them public [HERE](https://ramipastrami.engineering/)

I run a private GItea server, and am much more active there since pushing unity projects to github is a great way to exhaust storage limits. Please contact me for more information on it.

I use Github to release works that are intended to be (or soon become) public, and to collaborate with others on various projects.
