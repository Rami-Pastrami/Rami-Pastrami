Just doing some odd-ball stuff with VR and BCI, hoping to make enough money for rent while building my knowledge.

I run a private git server, and am much more active there since pushing unity projects to github is a great way to exhaust storage limits within a commit.

I use Github to release works that are intended to be (or soon become) public, and to collaborate with others
